                <p>I am a <em>Web Designer & Developer</em> living in London. I've been actively building my skills for several months now. I enjoy working in Photoshop and Illustrator, creating logos and developing brands. I also love coding websites, and trying to find my own style so that my websites don't look the same as others.</p>

                <p>But it wasn't always like that. Many years ago I was a classical musician, trying to survive by teaching piano. Then, when I was studying Music Technology at university, I was hooked by computers, so decided to enter the IT industry. Having been working in IT for a few years, I realised I wanted to create and design things.</p>
